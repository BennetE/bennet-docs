1. Run `npm init -y`
2. Run `tsc --init`
3. Add `"declaration": true` to the `tsconfig.json`
    - "This tells TypeScript to emit an `.ts` definitions file along with your compiled JavaScript."
4. Add `"types": "index.d.ts"` to the `package.json`
    - "When other people import your library, this tells the TypeScript compiler where to look for your libraryâ€™s types."
